# d3 heatmap
This is an implementation of a heatmap in d3 to visualize over 200 years of monthly land surface temperature. The dataset comes from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json).

## Getting Started
Simply put `heatmap.html` and `heatmap.js` in the same directory and open heatmap.html in your browser.

## Reading the Heatmap
The x-axis represents the year and y-axis the month. The color of each bar denotes the temperature recorded for that month.

This simple chart shows that the land surface temperature is getting hotter and hotter (more red) over time (global warming)!
